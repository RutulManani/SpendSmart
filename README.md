# SpendSmart

SpendSmart is a gamified app designed specifically for international students to help them avoid impulsive purchases influenced by emotions and develop better spending habits. Through daily financial challenges, students earn rewards while tracking expenses and understanding their emotional triggers. Instead of just logging purchases, it turns mindful spending into an interactive experience, making financial discipline fun and engaging.
